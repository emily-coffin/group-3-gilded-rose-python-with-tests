# DEMO

- Getting project using familiar tools to get current tests running:
  - poetry, pytest, ruff, makefile
- Refactored code into a readable state
- Re-wrote code from scratch instead of modifying the existing code while ensuring tests were still running

# Discussion

- At what point do you take a step back and ask if it is worth refactoring
- Do we have all the business needs, what it touches, what uses it?
- Test coverage in the project was solid enough, making the rewrite smoother
